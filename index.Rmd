# Welcome!

Here you will find the course pages of the project course *Data Science in Finance*.

The course is offered regularly in the summer term and aims at providing in-depth knowledge about the programming language Python and its most important libraries for data analysis. Students will learn to develop structured approaches for solving practical problems in a financial context using statistical methods. The final grade will be determined based on a case study of a financial dataset.
