# Structured Query Language

## Introduction to SQL

Structured Query Language (SQL) is commonly used to access and query large databases.

```{r include=FALSE}
library(reticulate)
repl_python()
```

## Querying data

Using the python package \textt{sqlalchemy} we can establish a connection to the database.
We need to provide the username, password, host and port to identify the database we want to connect to
in the form "mysql://default_user:q7$?h!4Mx@10.153.30.58:3306".

```{python}
import sqlalchemy as sa

engine = sa.create_engine('mysql://default_user:q7$?h!4Mx@10.153.30.58:3306')
connection = engine.connect()
```

The basic syntax of SQL is structured as follows
```{sql eval=FALSE}
SELECT {item} FROM {database}.{datatable} {alias}
WHERE {condition}
{more}
```

The wildcard * selects all columns of a table *aapl_wrds_cqm* and database *taqmsec*.
```{sql eval=FALSE}
SELECT * FROM taqmsec.aapl_wrds_cqm
```


## Filtering Data

We can further refine the query by allowing to filter for a set of conditions.

```{sql eval=FALSE}
SELECT *
FROM taqmsec.aapl_wrds_ctm
WHERE time(time) >= "09:30" 
AND time(time) <= "16:00"
AND ex = "P" OR ex = "O"
```

## Combining multiple tables

To combine two tables we can either use *UNION* or *JOIN*

```{sql eval=FALSE}
SELECT *,
(main.bid + main.ask)/2 as mid,
(main.ask - main.bid) as spread
FROM 
((SELECT 
a.time, 
a.qu_seqnum as seq, 
"q" as item,
NULL as price,
NULL as quantity,
NULL as sale_condition,
a.bid as bid, 
a.bidsiz as bidsize, 
a.ask as ask, 
a.asksiz as asksize
FROM cqm_opening_times a
WHERE ex = "P")
UNION ALL
(SELECT
b.time, 
b.tr_seqnum as seq, 
"t" as item,
b.price as price,
b.size as quantity,
b.tr_scond as sale_condition,
NULL as bid, 
NULL as bidsize, 
NULL as ask, 
NULL as asksize
FROM ctm_opening_times b
WHERE ex = "P")) as main
ORDER BY time;
```
